# KeyMotion Trainer (Preview)

Practice Helix/Vim/Kakoune-like movements in a safe, sandboxed buffer.

- Start: “KeyMotion: Start Training”
- Stop: “KeyMotion: Stop Training”
- Keys (initial set): h j k l w d, Escape
- Example: press `d` then `w` to delete the next word.

This is a minimal prototype for exploring mode/key routing and lesson flow.
